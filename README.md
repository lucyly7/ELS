## Hello.

The included PDFs include snippets of my R and Python code from various exercises obtained from the textbook "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. 
Each document includes my responses to said exercises and limited elaboration on my code.
This repository is intended to be a record of my progress through the textbook and a practical visual demonstration of the concepts I've learned or reviewed from the textbook.
